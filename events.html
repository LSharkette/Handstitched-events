            <p class='title'>Cotton</p>
            <p>The classic staple.  Just need someone to come in at the last minute to make your day perfect? Are you basically an amateur planner? If you need purely day-of coordination, this is the option for you. The day of your event, you will have a contact person for all vendors, someone to ensure the schedule runs smoothly, and set up/break down ‘til your heart is content.   You’ll need to cover scheduling, confirming vendors, arranging floor plans and décor, and all other relevant details.  I’ll pick everything up day-of and execute it seamlessly.

            <p class='title'>Linen</p>
            <p>Let’s talk it out! This coordinating package allows you up to three in-person meetings as you move through your planning process, as well as one accompanied vendor visit.  Leave the scheduling, contacting and vendor synchronizing to me! The week of your wedding or event, all of your vendors (and wedding party members) will be contacted with a schedule for the event.  From that point on, your vendors and VIPs have a contact so that you can enjoy the days leading up to your celebration.
            If your event requires a rehearsal, I will be there to run the show, or assist your officiant. The day of, I am on hand from set-up to break down, ensuring that the décor is flawless and the order of ceremony is followed. When your night is over, you can be sure all your vendor contracts have been satisfied and your venue is taken care of.</p>

            <p>Finely created and hand-spun.  If you are ready to hand over the reins for your event, from picking the date until the lights are turned off, I will handle it all.  You will be able to select your favorite vendors from my curated list, and leave the rest to me. I am available to you whenever you’d like to meet to chat about the progress of the event.  I will ensure all the details from décor & vendor coordination to the perfect food & libations, your event will be perfectly hand stitched.
